# Functional Programming Concepts

## Rating: 7/10

### Immutability: 7/10

- ✅ Uses immutable state management with Jotai
- ✅ Avoids direct state mutation
- ⚠️ Some mutable references in WebRTC code
- ⚠️ Limited use of immutable data structures
- ⚠️ Some mutable operations in flow logic

### Pure Functions: 8/10

- ✅ Most functions are pure
- ✅ Clear input/output relationships
- ✅ Minimal side effects
- ⚠️ Some impure functions in WebRTC handling
- ⚠️ Side effects in flow management

### Higher-Order Functions: 7/10

- ✅ Uses map/filter/reduce appropriately
- ✅ Function composition in flows
- ⚠️ Limited use of higher-order components
- ⚠️ Some imperative loops remain
- ⚠️ Could use more functional patterns

### Function Composition: 7/10

- ✅ Basic function composition in flows
- ✅ Pipeline patterns in some areas
- ⚠️ Nested function calls in some places
- ⚠️ Limited use of composition utilities
- ⚠️ Some imperative code patterns
