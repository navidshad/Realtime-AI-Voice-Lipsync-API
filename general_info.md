# Project Name: AI-Powered Interactive KodeKloud Assistant (APIKA)

## Problem Statement
Learners often struggle to navigate through large course libraries, leading to decision fatigue and drop-offs. Traditional filtering and browsing methods are insufficient for identifying the most suitable DevOps learning paths based on individual user goals, experience levels, and interests. This lack of personalization hinders user engagement and slows down course adoption.
## Objective
Build an AI-powered interactive consultant integrated into the KodeKloud applications to streamline the course discovery process. The consultant will provide real-time, voice- and text-based consultations, guiding users to the most relevant courses and learning paths through a dynamic and personalized interface.
## Proposed Solution
Implement a hybrid conversational AI assistant that engages users in a dedicated virtual consultation space. The assistant will assess user goals, recommend personalized learning paths, and display rich media content such as course cards. A session summary will be generated with curated next steps, enhancing decision-making and satisfaction.
## Requirements
- AI chatbot with real-time voice and text input/output.
- Integration with user profiling and course metadata for accurate recommendations.
- Visually interactive interface (animated agent, dynamic content display).
- Persistent session history and adaptive conversational logic.
- Responsive frontend built with React and TailwindCSS.
- AI backend powered by OpenAI GPT-4.0-mini with voice via OpenAI realtime API.
- Optional use of WebGL/WebRTC for animations and voice chat feel.
## User Stories
- As a learner, I want to have a conversation with an AI agent to find courses that match my experience and goals so I don't have to browse manually.
- As a learner, I want to see dynamic course cards and comparison tables so I can visually understand my options.
- As a learner, I want to receive a summary of the consultation session so I can revisit the recommendations later.
- As a product owner, I want to increase course enrollment and reduce drop-offs by improving the course discovery experience.
- As a developer, I want to design a friendly, hybrid interaction model so users can seamlessly switch between voice and text input.
